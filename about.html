						<h3>What’s going on here?</h3>
						<p>This site is intended to make my life a little simpler as an instructor (and contributing practitioner to the field). Let’s face it: a university education is difficult. It takes up an inordinate amount of time, and, while it is well worth it in the long run, a wee bit of organization certainly helps the cause.</p>
						
						<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
							<h3 class="alert-heading">Holla, friends.</h3>
							<img src="http://49.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0e0g7V2Ke1r5jtugo1_400.gif" style="width: 260px; margin: 0 0 0 1.5em; float: right;" class="img-thumbnail">
							<p class="mb-0">Additionally, this site is intended to give back to my colleagues in the interpreting community to whom I am indebted. There is a liberal <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0">Creative Commons license</a> covering materials available from this site; information and professional development should be <a href="http://opencontent.org/definition">open and sharable</a> within our interpreting community. This license does not apply, however, to work claimed by other authors and producers. Additionally, every intent has been made to make materials available via “Fair Use,” (§107 to 118, Title 17, US Code); the content and downloadable materials on the pages of this Web site are solely for the benefit of the students enrolled in these courses. We’re all trying to get and be better in this field; put your money where your mouth is.</p>
						</div>

						<p>This site is also an experiment in simplicity. Users hate to be frustrated when they use websites, so I’ve tried to make every contingency that I could think of. I’m sure you, gentle reader, will find areas that can be improved and so I invite your feedback.</p>
						<p>This entire site is standards-compliant; (for you gearheads) it is developed responsively in <abbr class="initialism">HTML5</abbr>, <abbr class="initialism">CSS3</abbr>, and is <abbr class="initialism">W3C</abbr> compliant. Within the body of the site, there is not one — no, not one — tdbody, colspan, or icky Microsoft FrontPage line of code included. Thanks to the beauty of cascading style sheets, everything you see before you is text-based.</p>
						<p>For those of you with iPhones, Android OS, and iPads, these sites will also display nicely on your devices (you might not have even noticed it; good for me). Resize your browser window or try your iPhone.</p>
						<p>Almost every downloadable file — readings, articles, class notes, syllabi, and other handouts — are saved in <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> formats and require <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">Adobe Acrobat Reader</a>. (There are a few sample Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, or OpenOffice bibliography templates available for download on the <a href="../3310/writing.html">class writing page</a>.) If the computer you are using does not have Acrobat or the Acrobat browser plugin, you can download the free Reader application.</p>

						<h3>About <abbr class="initialism">UVU</abbr>’s Courses</h3>
						<p>Let’s take this opportunity to clear up some myths:</p>
						<ol>
							<li><abbr class="initialism">UVU</abbr> has not, does not, nor does it plan to establish a full-blown interpreting training program, per se. There. It’s said. You can check with my boss on this one, but I’m pretty sure he’ll back me up.</li>
							<li>As of the end of Fall Semester 2010, the <abbr class="initialism">ACIPP</abbr> program has been discontinued. Please contact the Foreign Language office or Dr. Eldredge for more information about future <abbr class="initialism">UVU</abbr> interpreting paracertificate programs.</li>
							<li>As of Fall 2004, <abbr class="initialism">UVU</abbr> offers a <a href="http://www.uvu.edu/lang/asl/minor.html">minor in ASL and Deaf Studies</a> and as of Fall 2007, a <a href="http://www.uvu.edu/lang/asl/general.html">bachelor’s degree in ASL and Deaf Studies</a>. That’s fairly exciting, seeing that there are literally a handful of such programs offered in the United States and you get to come all the way to Utah to get your degree.</li>
						</ol>
						<p><a href="http://www.uvu.edu/catalog/current/courses/american-sign-language">Read the class descriptions</a> at the department ASL website or if you’re interested in learning how these courses are applied towards your degree, contact ASL Department Chair, Bryan Eldredge, eldredbr (at) uvu.edu.</p>

						<h3>Contact Information</h3>
						<p>If you need to contact me, the best way is via email or text. If you absolutely must use the talkie phone, you may call my mobile phone — ask me for the number first. So email me at dstringham (at) gmail.com. Rest assured, I’m very responsive to e-mail so I’ll get your information one way or the other.</p>
						<p>You can also schedule appointments with me on campus either before/after class.</p>
						<p>And I suppose if you really don’t want to talk to me, you could bother my department head: Dr. Bryan Eldredge, eldredbr (at) uvu.edu, CB 310F; (801) 921-4371 VP.</p>

						<h3>Deaf Latter-day Saint (Mormon) Community Research</h3>
						<p>Since 2009, fellow interpreting and research colleague <a href="http://anneleahy.com">Anne Leahy</a> and I have been working on unearthing, recreating, and returning stories of the Deaf Latter-day Saint tradition and history back to the community. Although there is evidence of Deaf Latter-day Saint worshippers as early as 1832, this domain of research has historically been neglected and malreported. We have given several formal and informal presentations on Utah’s nineteenth-century Deaf Latter-day Saint community and historical events to various venues and gatherings; see <a href="http://history.deaflds.org">Rediscovering the History of Deaf Latter-day Saints</a> for more information on presentations and topics.</li>
