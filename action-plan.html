                <h5>Self-paced Action Plan</h5>
			    <hr>

				<!-- Definition -->
                <p class="lead"><strong>What are discourse markers?</strong> Incorporate effective words, phrases, pausing, or nonmanual behaviors that create cohesion in a conversation or lecture by linking together ideas and signaling what will happen next (examples given ).</p>

				<!-- Diagnostic Observations -->
                <h3>Diagnostic Observations (What’s causing the miscues in my work?)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>“I don’t understand exactly what the deaf person said in ASL.” (comprehension)</li>
					<li>“The source information is unfamiliar.” (background knowledge)</li>
					<li>“I don’t have a clear mental picture of what the deaf person meant.” (visualization)</li>
					<li>“Using equivalent English vocabulary and grammar, I don’t know how to interpret what the deaf person meant.” (reformulation)</li>
					<li>“While I was interpreting, did I simultaneously check my interpretation to see if it made sense?” (monitoring)</li>
					<li>“”</li>
					<li>“”</li>
				</ul>

                <!-- Interpretation examples -->
                <h3>Examples</h3>
                <p>Examples of discourse markers include English words and phrases like</p>
				<table class="table">
					<tr>
						<td><strong>oh</strong> (I understand; I have something to add)<td>
						<td><strong>okay</strong> (opening a topic; agreement; back-channeling)<td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>now</strong> (opening a topic)<td>
						<td><strong>then</strong> (shifting in time or sequence)<td>
					</tr>

                <!-- Self-paced Production Activities !-->
			    <h3>Self-paced Production Activities</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Create an audio recording of yourself explaining in English your three favorite vacations, why you would consider it one of your favorites, and certain things that you did during your time away. Afterwards, note in your journal occasions of movement between concepts or topic transitions where an appropriate discourse marker was used to convey a natural English message.</li>
					<li>Film an ASL-to-English interpretation of the “Green Hills College” scenario from the NIC Performance and Interview Practice DVD, focusing on appropriately incorporating effective English discourse markers (see examples below). Review your interpretation and mark any awkward transitions and potential root causes. Journal the potential consequences to both consumers regarding less effective instances of discourse markers used.</li>
